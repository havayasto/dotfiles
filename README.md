# dotfiles for my clean and minimalist workstation setup

## Synopsis

I made this repository for more sophisticated configuration files of applications I use daily use. My outlook is to find a  balance between functionality and aesthetics while keeping an eye on resource consumption. I put a lot of care into a consistent and pleasant look and feel, that is easy on the eyes.
